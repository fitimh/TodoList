## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

----------

# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/fitimh/TodoList.gitt

Switch to the repo folder

    cd laravel-todo-todolist

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@github.com:gothinkster/laravel-realworld-example-app.git
    cd laravel-realworld-example-app
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan jwt:generate 
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
   
# Code overview

***Note*** : You can quickly set the database information and other variables in this file and have the application fully working.

----------

# Testing API

Run the laravel development server

    php artisan serve

The api can now be accessed at

    http://localhost:8000/api

Request headers

| **Required** 	| **Key**              	| **Value**            	|
|----------	|------------------	|------------------	|
| Yes      	| Content-Type     	| application/json 	|
| Yes      	| X-Requested-With 	| XMLHttpRequest   	|
| Optional 	| Authorization    	| Token {JWT}      	|

Refer the [api specification](#api-specification) for more info.

----------
 
# Authentication
 
This applications uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to handle authentication. The token is passed with each request using the `Authorization` header with `Token` scheme. The JWT authentication middleware handles the validation and authentication of the token. Please check the following sources to learn more about JWT.
 
- https://jwt.io/introduction/
- https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html

----------

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
 
This applications has CORS enabled by default on all API endpoints. The default configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4200` to help speed up your frontend testing. The CORS allowed origins can be changed by setting them in the config file. Please check the following sources to learn more about CORS.
